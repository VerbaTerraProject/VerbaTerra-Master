# Nexus Facilitation Guide

Welcome to the coordination centre for VerbaTerra experiences. Use this panel to assemble classroom pathways, research prompts, and community labs.

## Session Flow

1. **Prime the story world** – start in the Hub and share the mission narrative.
2. **Run the simulation** – launch vSION with preset parameters that mirror your learning goals.
3. **Explore language shifts** – hand off to NΦRA for lexicon experimentation.
4. **Interrogate the data** – switch to Analyst to quantify NLIS/CRM trends.
5. **Reflect and publish** – use embed snippets to share highlights or asynchronous workspaces.

## Tips

- Encourage learners to journal parameter choices before sharing links.
- Compare two parameter presets side by side and discuss trade-offs.
- Remix the provided CSV sample to include class-generated data.
- Use the embed generator to publish daily digests on Google Sites.
