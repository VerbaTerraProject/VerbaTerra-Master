# Robustness & Directionality Validation

**Reverse-causality tests.** Swap roles of X and Y and confirm degraded fit.  
**Placebo outcomes.** Use variables with no theoretical link to culture; expect null effects.  
**Head‑to‑head directionality.** Compare candidate DAGs (culture→language vs language→culture) via out-of-sample error and information criteria.  
**Stability checks.** Resample, re-seed, and perturb priors; metrics and signs should remain stable.
