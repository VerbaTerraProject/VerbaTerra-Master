# VerbaTerra v1.0

VerbaTerra is a cultural–linguistic research environment that combines
simulation engines, CALR metrics, and ICLHF predictive models into a single
workflow. This documentation site describes how to install the toolkit,
execute reproducible experiments, and extend the ecosystem with new labs and
models.

## Key capabilities

- **Simulation Engines** – vSION, CCH, and NΦRA produce synthetic datasets of
  ritual, trade, symbolism, and hierarchy signals.
- **Metrics** – CALR provides NLIS (Neuro-Linguistic Integration Score) and CRM
  (Cultural Resilience Metric) for tracking cultural balance and linguistic
  cohesion.
- **Models** – The ICLHF model learns cultural → linguistic causation for
  downstream forecasting, transfer, and evaluation pipelines.
- **Command Line Tools** – Unified CLIs for running simulations, computing
  metrics, training models, and evaluating cross-run performance.
