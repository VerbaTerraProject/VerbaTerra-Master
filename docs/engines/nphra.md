# NΦRA (NPHRA) — Neuromorphic/Quantum Concept

Experimental core for **adaptive identity** and **cognitive parallelism**.  
Prototype hooks for attention-like modulation over symbolic density, and exploratory quantum-inspired transitions for cultural state exploration. (Stubbed in code; documented to guide future modules.)
