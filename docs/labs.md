# Experimental Labs

The VerbaTerra labs provide curated sandboxes for comparing the engines across
CALR metrics and engine-specific diagnostics.

## vSION Lab — Adaptive Cognition & Cultural Syntax

- Run: `python -m verbaterra.engines.vsion.lab_demo`
- Dataset size: 240 rows (default)
- Outputs: NLIS/CRM means plus `adaptive_pressure` summary
- Interpretation: Higher adaptive pressure correlates with stronger NLIS values
  when trade and symbolism remain balanced.

## CCH Lab — Ritual Diffusion & Hierarchy Balance

- Run: `python -m verbaterra.engines.cch.lab_demo`
- Dataset size: 180 rows (default)
- Outputs: Descriptive statistics for diffusion and collective memory alongside
  NLIS/CRM
- Interpretation: Ritual coherence and hierarchy balance jointly elevate CRM,
  highlighting CALR sensitivity to ritual diffusion shocks.

## NΦRA Lab — Quantum Resonance & Neuroplasticity

- Run: `python -m verbaterra.engines.nphra.lab_demo`
- Dataset size: 160 rows (default)
- Outputs: Resonance mean, neuro-coherence peak, NLIS upper quantile
- Interpretation: Oscillatory coherence drives lexical gains; high neuro
  coherence with moderate hierarchy stabilises CRM while boosting NLIS extremes.

## Publishing lab reports

Use the lab demos to seed MkDocs pages, Jupyter notebooks, or research briefs.
Augment results with additional CALR metrics or by overlaying empirical data to
stress-test cultural hypotheses.
