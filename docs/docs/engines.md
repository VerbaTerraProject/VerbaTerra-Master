# Engine Overview

## Hub

The hub is the front door for VerbaTerra Lab. It introduces the mission, presents navigation cards for each engine, and provides ready-made iframe snippets. Copy buttons help embed experiences in LMS platforms or Google Sites.

## vSION

vSION simulates a simplified civilisation network. Adjustable sliders drive cultural pressures (ritual, trade, symbolism, hierarchy). A deterministic simulation seed keeps results reproducible. Outputs include:

- A force-based node canvas with colour-coded cultural affinities
- A metrics line chart powered by Chart.js showing aggregate evolution
- URL hash encoding for shareable parameter states

## NΦRA

NΦRA exposes a symbolic rule interpreter. Predefined rule templates (borrowing, compounding, semantic shift) are weighted by cultural factors. Users can edit the input lexicon, generate transformed forms, and download results as CSV for further analysis.

## Analyst

Analyst focuses on data interrogation. Users can upload CSV files or load the provided example dataset. The module infers schema using header parsing, computes NLIS and CRM demonstration metrics, and renders responsive charts (distribution and scatter plots) alongside sortable tables.

## Nexus

Nexus is designed for educators and researchers. It renders guidance from Markdown, exposes quick launch links with preset parameters, and includes an embed code generator that produces iframe snippets tailored to Google Sites or LMS usage.
