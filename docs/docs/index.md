# VerbaTerra Lab

Welcome to the VerbaTerra Lab documentation portal. This site accompanies the static monorepo and provides conceptual grounding for each engine, along with deployment and embedding guides.

## Modules

- **Hub** – a shared landing page that links to the engines and exposes reusable embed snippets.
- **vSION** – a lightweight civilization simulation emphasising the relationship between ritual, trade, symbolism, and hierarchy.
- **NΦRA** – a symbolic grammar workshop for modelling lexical drift across cultural pressures.
- **Analyst** – CSV-oriented metrics explorer that produces demonstrative NLIS and CRM calculations.
- **Nexus** – educator and researcher cockpit with presets and embed tooling.

## Why Static?

The lab targets frictionless sharing: each engine compiles to a single HTML file with inline assets, making it suitable for Netlify, GitHub Pages, offline demos, and Google Sites embeds.
