# Overview

VerbaTerra treats **language as a cultural algorithm**. Culture (ritual, trade, symbolism, hierarchy) drives linguistic structure and cognitive load; in turn, linguistic adaptability contributes to **cultural resilience**.

This site documents the theory, simulation engines, metrics, validation routines, and data policy that power the VerbaTerra ecosystem.
