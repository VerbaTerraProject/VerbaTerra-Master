# CALR — Cultural Adaptation & Linguistic Resilience

**Claim.** Linguistic adaptability contributes to **cultural resilience** under change.

**CRM (Cultural Resilience Metric).** Combines:
- Positive: trade, symbolism (diversification & narrative cohesion)
- Negative: hierarchy extremes (fragility)
- Modulator: ritual stability (shock absorption)

**Policy intuition.** Multilingual education and symbolic richness improve community resilience; extreme centralization is brittle.
