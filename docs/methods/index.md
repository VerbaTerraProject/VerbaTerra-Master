# Methods Overview

VerbaTerra couples two methodological pillars:

- **ICLHF (Integrated Cultural-Linguistic Harmonics Framework)** — captures the
  interplay between ritual practice, trade cohesion, symbolic exchange, and
  hierarchical balance to explain linguistic resilience.
- **CALR (Cultural Adaptive Learning Response)** — quantifies resilience and
  integration using NLIS and CRM metrics derived from simulated communities.

Each subpage details the statistical assumptions and algorithmic steps used by
the simulator, metrics, and learning routines.
